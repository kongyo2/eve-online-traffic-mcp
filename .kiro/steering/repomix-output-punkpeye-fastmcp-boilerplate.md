This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.
The content has been processed where line numbers have been added, content has been formatted for parsing in markdown style, security check has been disabled.

# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Line numbers have been added to the beginning of each line
- Content has been formatted for parsing in markdown style
- Security check has been disabled - content may contain sensitive information
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

 1: # FastMCP Boilerplate
 2: 
 3: A boilerplate for [FastMCP](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp).
 4: 
 5: This boilerplate is a good starting point for building an MCP server. It includes a basic setup for testing, linting, formatting, and publishing to NPM.
 6: 
 7: ## Development
 8: 
 9: To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.
10: 
11: ```bash
12: git clone https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp-boilerplate.git
13: cd fastmcp-boilerplate
14: npm install
15: npm run dev
16: ```
17: 
18: > [!NOTE]
19: > If you are starting a new project, you may want to fork [fastmcp-boilerplate](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp-boilerplate) and start from there.
20: 
21: ### Start the server
22: 
23: If you simply want to start the server, you can use the `start` script.
24: 
25: ```bash
26: npm run start
27: ```
28: 
29: However, you can also interact with the server using the `dev` script.
30: 
31: ```bash
32: npm run dev
33: ```
34: 
35: This will start the server and allow you to interact with it using CLI.
36: 
37: ### Testing
38: 
39: A good MCP server should have tests. However, you don't need to test the MCP server itself, but rather the tools you implement.
40: 
41: ```bash
42: npm run test
43: ```
44: 
45: In the case of this boilerplate, we only test the implementation of the `add` tool.
46: 
47: ### Linting
48: 
49: Having a good linting setup reduces the friction for other developers to contribute to your project.
50: 
51: ```bash
52: npm run lint
53: ```
54: 
55: This boilerplate uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [TypeScript ESLint](https://typescript-eslint.io/) to lint the code.
56: 
57: ### Formatting
58: 
59: Use `npm run format` to format the code.
60: 
61: ```bash
62: npm run format
63: ```
64: 
65: ### GitHub Actions
66: 
67: This repository has a GitHub Actions workflow that runs linting, formatting, tests, and publishes package updates to NPM using [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).
68: 
69: In order to use this workflow, you need to:
70: 
71: 1. Add `NPM_TOKEN` to the repository secrets
72:    1. [Create a new automation token](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/punkpeye/tokens/new)
73:    2. Add token as `NPM_TOKEN` environment secret (Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions → "Manage environment secrets" → "release" → Add environment secret)
74: 1. Grant write access to the workflow (Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Read and write permissions")
